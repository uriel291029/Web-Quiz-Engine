# Web-Quiz-Engine

## About

This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. For this project, it was developed on a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.

## Description

On the Internet, you can often find sites where you need to answer questions: educational sites, sites with psychological tests, job search services, or just entertaining sites like web quests. Something they all have in common is that they permit to answer questions (or quizzes) and then see the results.

This project was develped with a multi-user web service for creating and solving quizzes using REST API, an embedded database, security, and other technologies.
